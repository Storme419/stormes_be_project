# Northcoders News API

Two files have been added to gitignore and must be added by you in order to successfully connect to the two databases locally.
To have access to envirimental variables create a file named .env.development and .env.test. Look inside the .env-example file to get an idea of what we need inside then move to your new .env.development file and similarly type PGDATABASE=nc_news and for the other file type PGDATABASE=nc_news_test.
